## It is additionally possible to setup DR for the performance replica.
## Redo the DR step from DR with the performance replica as DR primary
## and a new cluster (machine) as DR secondary.

#######################################################################

# To promote a DR secondary to a primary cluster, a DR operation token must be generated.
# First we will check to see if the 'generate operation token' process has not been initiated.
# These operations are completed on the DR secondary (vault3).
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8204/v1/sys/replication/dr/secondary/generate-operation-token/attempt | jq .
